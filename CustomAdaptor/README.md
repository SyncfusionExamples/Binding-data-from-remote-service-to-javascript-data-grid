# CustomAdaptor in Syncfusion Grid

The CustomAdaptor in Syncfusion Grid allows to create their own custom adaptors by extending the built-in adaptors. The custom adaptor involves handling the query process, requests, and responses of the built-in adaptor. The CustomAdaptor can be used to extend OData V4 services, enabling efficient data fetching and manipulation.
