# Connecting GraphQL Service with Javascript Grid Control

GraphQL is a powerful query language for APIs, designed to provide a more efficient alternative to traditional REST APIs. It allows you to precisely fetch the data you need, reducing over-fetching and under-fetching of data. GraphQL provides a flexible and expressive syntax for querying, enabling clients to request only the specific data they require.

Syncfusionâ€™s Grid component seamlessly integrates with GraphQL servers using the GraphQLAdaptor in the DataManager. This specialized adaptor simplifies the interaction between the Syncfusion Grid and GraphQL servers, allowing efficient data retrieval with support for various operations like CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete), paging, sorting, and filtering.
