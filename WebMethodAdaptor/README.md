# WebMethodAdaptor in Syncfusion Grid Component

The WebMethodAdaptor in Syncfusion Grid facilitates data binding from remote services using web methods. This powerful feature enables efficient communication between the client-side application and the server. The WebMethodAdaptor, like the URL adaptor, sends query parameters encapsulated within an object named value. Within this value object, various datamanager properties such as requiresCounts, skip, take, sorted, and where queries are included.
